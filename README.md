# Clock

Just a simple app that tells you your current local time. 

Purpose of the project was simply for me to under how the npm works. I installed the npm package, "moment". Learned that I could only run the module in the server and not browser.

One way to overcome this limitation, I copied the entire function available in the moment.js file in the package and paste it into my own .js file.
